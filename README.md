📊 Vendor Performance Analysis
Welcome to the Vendor Performance Analysis project! This is a data analysis project aimed at evaluating and understanding how vendors are performing based on sales, returns, and other key performance metrics.

This project pulls together multiple raw data sources, cleans and processes them, and finally produces a clear vendor_sales_summary.csv — a concise summary that highlights vendor-wise sales performance. The analysis includes key indicators such as sales volume, returns, margins, and more.

🧠 Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:
Analyze and evaluate vendor performance
Identify top-performing vendors based on sales and return metrics
Support data-driven decision-making for procurement and inventory management

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Power BI (for interactive dashboarding)
CSV Files for raw and processed data

📈 Key Output
The heart of the project is the vendor_sales_summary.csv, which includes:
Total sales per vendor
Total returns
Net sales
Return rate
Profit margin (if data available)

🧪 How to Run
