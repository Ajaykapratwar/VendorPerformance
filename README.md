# 📊 Vendor Performance Analysis

Welcome to the **Vendor Performance Analysis** project — a hands-on data analysis project focused on understanding how vendors perform based on sales, returns, profitability, and other key business metrics.

This project combines data from multiple sources, cleans and transforms it, and generates a smart, easy-to-use summary file: `vendor_sales_summary.csv`. It's designed to help teams make informed decisions in procurement and inventory management.
